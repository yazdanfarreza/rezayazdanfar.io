title: Meta-Learning for Time Series Forecasting (DeepTime) in PyTorch Lightning
subtitle: Meta-Learning for Time Series Forecasting (DeepTime) in PyTorch Lightning
summary: This article is devoted to describing a new type of deep learning model to cope with the usual problems in time series (covariate shift and conditional distribution shift)-come from being non-stationary-by using meta-learning formulation to forecast the future. The model is named DeepTime, which is a deep time-index model combined with using meta-learning. This model is a great example of the modelâ€™s synergies with a meta-learning formulation for time series forecasting.
