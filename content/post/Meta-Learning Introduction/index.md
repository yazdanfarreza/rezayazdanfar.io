title: N-HiTS Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series Forecasting
subtitle: 
summary: This article describes a new architecture to solve previous models’ issues 1. Predicting with instability 2. Computational complication by obtaining hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling successfully. The architecture includes several Stacks, each Stack includes several Block, where each block consists of a MaxPool layer, a Multi-Layer-Perceptron layer, and θ. The N-HiTS model outperforms previous transformer-based architectures (25% improvement), which is described thoroughly.
