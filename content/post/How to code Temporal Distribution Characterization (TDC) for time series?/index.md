title: How to code Temporal Distribution Characterization (TDC) for time series?
subtitle: 
summary: There is no need to express the necessity of forecasting time series data by deep learning methods. I did provide an article about how we can handle the variations in statistical features (particularly, distribution perspective), which can lead us to a disaster. The model proposed is named AdaRNN, including two main initiatives, TDC and TDM. This article is going to illustrate TDC in detail.
