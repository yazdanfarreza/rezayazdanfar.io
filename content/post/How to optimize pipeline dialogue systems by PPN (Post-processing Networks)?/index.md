subtitle: 
summary: It’s a human destination to create intelligence. Throughout recent years, we’ve progressed dramatically with advances in Artificial Intelligence, especially in Reinforcement learning. TODSs (Task-oriented dialogue systems) are getting more and more attention in industries to save money and time. TODSs perform an aim that is defined by a user in natural language. Mostly, we use a pipeline approach containing various modules. This article illustrates a method to optimize a complete pipeline system.
